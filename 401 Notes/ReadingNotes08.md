# Collections

Collections provide a more useful way of working with groups of objects rather than an array. A collection is a class, so you have to declare an instance of the class before you can add objects to that collection, and the group of objects can grow and shrink dynamically unlike an array.

There are three types of collections. A generic collection, A current collection, and a regular collection. A generic collection is useful when every item in the collection has the same data type. A current collection provides efficient thread-safe operations for accessing collection items from multiple threads. With a regular collection, they do not store elements as specifically typed objects, but as objects of type Object.
