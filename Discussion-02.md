## Choosing a text editor
  
  There is no right or wrong choice for a text editor. When choosing a text editor, you will find many different varieties, but it really comes down to your personal preference. With so many on the internet to pick from, it can be hard to choose, but here are a few things to look for in text editors.
  
  - **Syntax** Highlighting
  - Themes
  - Code Completion
  - Extensions

  This list of features makes it much easier on the person coding, and can make the process quicker and more efficient. Finding a text editor that has all of these things listed would definitly be a good choice. Although a lot of text editors have these things, there are some you want to avoid, the biggest one being editors that allow you to underline, bold, or italicize the font of the text. When coding you should only be doing these things through syntax.
  
## Terminal

  The terminal is basically the window that allows you to communicate with your computer. There is a lot to learn when it comes to the terminal, and I am still learning myself. The basics of a terminal is, you enter a command, and the computer gives you an output of that command. You can do a variety of things with commands. The simple command ls (standing for list) will give you the contents of the current directory you are in. ls /etc will give you the contents of the directory you are in and not the directory itself. These are just a couple examples of commands and there are tons more. Paths help tell the computer where we want the commands to take place. Using a tilde(~) will direct you to your home directory without having to type the whole thing out. a dot(.) will show you your current directory, and two dots(..) will direct you to the parent directory, or the one above above your current.
