## Using HTML

<p>The main purpose of HTML is to structure your websites. For example, if you wanted certain text to be highlighted, bordered, or even if you want to add a picture, HTML is what you would use to do that. This is very important in a website, as it is the part that will catch the users eye, and help them navigate around the site. Without HTML a website would look more like a word document because there would be no way of moving text to a certain part of the page, and no way of adding color and images.</p>
<p>Just like any other form of coding, HTML uses syntax to change the look of the page. For example, if you wanted to make a paragraph you use the letter p inside of less than and greater than symbols(<>). To end the paragraph you use the same symbol, but with a forward slash(/) in front of the p. Below is a list of different HTML commands.</p>

<ul>
<li>head - The document head.</li><li>title - The page title.</li><li>body - The pages content.</li><li>h1 - The pages first heading.</li><li>p - To make a aparagraph.</li><li>a - Used to make link.</li><li>img - Used to add image.</li><li>span - Used to make an inline container for content.</li>
</ul>
