# JavaScript

<p>In previous discussions, we went over css and html, and the uses of these. Today we are talking about JavaScript. JavaScript is similar to css and html as it helps make a website more attractive to the user and also adds efficiency when navigating. The main difference is that unlike css and html, JavaScript allows the user to interact with the page in many different ways. Here is a list of things you can do with JavaScript. </p>
