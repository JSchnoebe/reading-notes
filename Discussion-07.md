#Programming with JavaScript

<p>In order to start adding javaScript to your website, you need to know the basics. The two main parts of JavaScript are functions and operators. JavaScript has both binary and unary operators. Binary operators perform actions with two operands while unary performs with just one. An example of binary would be 5+6 or x*y. An example of unary would be x++ or x**.</p> 
<p>The other part of JavaScript, <u>functions</u>, are a set of statements that perform a task. So your input is the function, and the output is the result of that function. The syntax of the funtion has three parts. The first being the function keyword, the second part is the name of that function, and the third part is the parentheses. Inside the parentheses you put your parameters seperated by commas. at the end of your function, you put open curly brackets which contain the code that is to be executed by the function. An example of this would be:

function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
  // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}</p>
