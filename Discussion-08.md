# Loops

<p>Loops are a very important and useful tool used in JavaScript. It allows you to repeat something over and over a certain amount of times. There are many different kinds of loops, each one allowing for different start and end points of the loop. The two main ones I want to discuss are *For* and *While* loops.</p>
<p>The statement *for* will repeat itself until a certain condition is false. When a *for* loop is executed, there are a few things that occur.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The InitialExpression is executed.</li>
    <li>The ConditionExpression is evaluated.</li>
    <li>The Statement executes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement *while* executes its statement as long as the specified conditions are evaluated and they are true. A *while* statement looks like this.

while (condition)
  statement

If the condition is false, the statement stops executing. If the condition is true, the statement executes and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false after being tested, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement after while.</p>
