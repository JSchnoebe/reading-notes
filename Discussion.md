#Discussion Assignment
##Markdown
In practicing Markdown on GitHub I've earned a lot about how to use it. In my words, markdown is used to change the look of the text in your webpage using symbols. For example, the title "Discussion Assignment" is made larger by using the pound sign(#) in front of it. To make a title a little smaller you can use two or three pound signs in front of the text. The more you use, the smaller the text. There are many other symbols used to change the appearance of text in a web page. Another example is the star symbol. If you put a star in front and after a group of text you make it *italicized*. If you use two star symbols, the text will be **bold**.
##Practicing Markdown
The best way to learn markdown yourself is practice. If you search markdown language on google, there are a lot of good cheat sheets to look off of and practice yourself. Create a repository on GitHub and use some of the symbols you learned on text. Once the page is rendered, you will see the affects the markdown has on the page.
