**Hello, my name is Jaren.**

## Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset in my own words is the want to learn, and always finding new ways to better yourself. For example, someone who is always asking questions in class, and wants to learn rather than just get through it. Other examples could be people who look for the challenge rather than the easy way out, and never gives up when things get too hard.

*Here are 3 reminders to keep in a Growth Mindset.*

- Embrace Challenges
- **Never** Give Up
- Give 100% Effort
