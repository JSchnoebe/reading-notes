# File Manipulation / System.IO

File manipulation is the way the computer transfers data to and from a storage medium. The input is the transfer of data to the computer, for exaple clicking on a link. The output is the response to the input. When you click on a link, it sends you to another address, that is the output.

System.IO contains types that allow reading and writing (or input and output) to files. This allows you to do things like search for things on the internet and get a response based on the search. Reading vs. Writing is the input vs output. Reading reads data types as binary values in the code to help capture what the input is. Writing is the words that can be shown on a web page.
