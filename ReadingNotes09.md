# LINQ & Delegates

Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. A query is an expression that retrieves data from a data source. Queries are usually expressed in a specialized query language. With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of LINQ is the query expression.
